<h2>Lesson 7 Home Work</h2>

<blockquote>
    Using the project created in the lab, add a new Controller class, “Foo”. Add the view for the
    Index() method of this controller. Add an additional method to the controller class “Bar”. The
    Bar() method should add a ChewingGum property to the ViewBag object (you can decide
    which gum to add, my favorite is “Big Red”). Add the View for the Bar() method. In the view,
    display the ChewingGum from the ViewBag. Create hyperlinks from the Index and Bar
    views. Use relative URLs for your hyperlinks.

<h4>My Favorite Gum is: @ViewBag.favGum.</h4>
